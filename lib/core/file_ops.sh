# ============================================================================
# Unified deletion helper (Trash + permanent routing with forensic log)
# ============================================================================

# Route a deletion through either macOS Trash or permanent rm, while logging
# every call for forensic review. Designed for destructive paths where undo
# matters (e.g. uninstall). Not used by cache-clean paths.
#
# Usage: mole_delete <path> [needs_sudo=false] [expected_dev_inode_mtime]
#
# Environment:
#   MOLE_DELETE_MODE      "permanent" (default) or "trash"; other values fail
#   MOLE_DRY_RUN=1        Log intent, do not delete
#   MOLE_TEST_TRASH_DIR   Test-only override; Trash moves go here via `mv`
#                         instead of Finder/trash CLI. Required for bats.
#   MOLE_DELETE_LOG       Override the log file path (default:
#                         ~/Library/Logs/mole/deletions.log)
#
# Returns 0 on success and a nonzero MOLE_ERR_* code on failure. Always appends a tab-separated line to
# the deletions log: <iso_ts>\t<mode>\t<size_kb>\t<status>\t<path>.
# size_kb is "unknown" when du could not measure the path (permission denied,
# disappeared mid-call); never silently coerced to 0KB so post-hoc forensics
# can tell measured-zero from measurement-failure.
# Linux Trash routing (contract §6). Default delete mode stays "trash": move
# the path with `gio trash` when the platform resolver reports gio. Returns 0
# when the item moved to Trash; nonzero otherwise. The caller owns timeout
# cancellation, the one-time user notice, and the permanent-delete fallback.

# up in tight loops (e.g. external-volume ._* sweeps, Application Support log
# scans). macOS st_blocks and 'du -skP' use the same 512-byte allocation basis
# without following symlinks. Directories still go through 'du' because 'stat'
# only reports a single directory entry, not recursive content size. .app
# bundles use Spotlight's physical size when available so uninstall previews
