# Mole - Centralized timeout constants for run_with_timeout calls.
#
# Goal: when someone needs to tune "all quick command-availability probes"
# or "all package-manager cleanup ceilings", they edit ONE place instead
# of grepping 100+ call sites.
#
# Naming: MOLE_TIMEOUT_<CATEGORY>_SEC. All values are seconds (integer or
# fractional). All are overridable via the same-named env var so operators
# can lengthen them for slow disks / cold Spotlight / etc.
#
# Categories (with rationale, not "what they happen to be tuned to"):
#
#   QUICK_DETECT      command -v + version-check style probes. Should fail
#                     fast when the tool is missing or wedged. ~2s.
#   SHORT_QUERY       Lightweight subprocess query (df, stat). ~3s.
#   MEDIUM_PROBE      Heavier probe that occasionally talks to the network
#                     or scans a directory tree. ~5s.
#   PKG_LIST          Package manager listing (dpkg/rpm/pacman -Q queries).
#                     ~10s.
#   PKG_CLEANUP       Cache cleanup commands that walk disks. ~20s.
#   DISK_VERIFY       Filesystem-level verify/repair operations. ~30s.
#   HINT_SCAN         Non-destructive scan that walks an unbounded user
#                     directory tree (project-artifact discovery). Per-listing
#                     finds are already capped; this is the cumulative
#                     wall-clock ceiling for the whole walk so it can never
#                     appear hung. ~15s.
#
# Migration: new code should use these constants. Existing call sites can
# be migrated incrementally; the script `grep 'run_with_timeout [0-9]'` lists
# remaining literal-timeout calls.
#
# Intentionally NOT in this table (values that appear hardcoded in lib/):
#
#   1s    Volume/filesystem type probes that should be near-instant on a
#         healthy disk: `df -T`, `find -maxdepth 1`. A wedge here usually
#         means the volume itself is sick; failing fast is the right
#         behavior.
#   8s    External tool calls that are too slow for MEDIUM_PROBE (5s) but
#         shouldn't pay the PKG_LIST (10s) ceiling: package-manager warm-up
#         retries and deep bounded `find` sweeps over kernel/GPU cache
#         trees - same "occasionally slow disk probe" shape.
#   15s   Long-running maintenance ops on user-selected targets such as a
#         journal vacuum or a distro-package cache rebuild. Different shape
#         from PKG_CLEANUP (20s) - keep them apart so tuning one doesn't
#         move the other.
#
# If you find yourself adding a new use of one of these literals, consider
# whether a bucket actually exists for it before copying the magic number.

# Clamp a per-command timeout to an overall wall-clock deadline. Kept beside
# the timeout policy constants because cleanup, uninstall, and file operations
# all need the same cumulative-budget behavior, including when those modules
# are sourced independently in tests or integrations.
#
# Deadlines are counted in SECONDS, which advances in whole seconds. A caller
# that builds one as `SECONDS + 1` is really asking for "until the next second
# boundary", so the budget can collapse to almost nothing and this returns 124
# before the command ever runs. Every constant above is >= 2 for that reason;
# keep new budgets there too, and never assert on a one-second bound in tests.
