"""Find shell functions that are the same code wearing different names.

Grepping for a name does not find this class. The copies that matter are the
ones where someone renamed the variables: `_dev_safe_clean_process_guarded` and
`_user_safe_clean_process_guarded` differed only by a `_MOLE_DEV_` vs
`_MOLE_USER_` prefix, and nine delete guards each re-implemented the same
six-line process-state translation. Reviewing by name reads all of them as
distinct helpers.

So compare structure instead: strip comments, then rewrite local identifiers and
string literals to placeholders, and hash what is left. Functions that collapse
to the same hash are the same function.

The duplication itself is rarely the bug. The bug is that one copy drifts and
the other copies still read correctly in review, which is how a guard folding
"could not tell" into "not running" survives a careful reading of its eight
siblings. That is why this is a gate and not a report.

Usage:
    scripts/audit_function_duplication.py            # gate, exits non-zero on a new group
    scripts/audit_function_duplication.py --list     # show every group, exit 0
